## Purpose

To create a simple README generator to better organize my future projects and allow me more time to work on the projects themselves.

## Installation

The current application requires installing Node.js and Inquirer version 8.2.4. From there, it is simply run by opening a terminal from the repo folder and entering the command "node index.js".

## Usage

After installing the necessary packages and initializing the code, the application will prompt the user to type the sections of their README file by responding to the questions that appear and pressing the "enter" key once finished with each response.

## Credits

* npm to run Node.js
* Inquirer version 8.2.4
* VS Code
* GitBash
* GitHub

## Contributing

Please feel free to clone the code to use as your own within the scope of the license. Please also feel free to make pull requests as you please. I will be quite active on GitHub for the foreseeable future. If you have further questions, please contact me [here](#questions)

## Tests

Inputting a variety of data to the application via the Inquirer responses would be the best method of testing the project. Iâ€™m sure that there are further improvements to make, which I plan to find and complete in the near future.
